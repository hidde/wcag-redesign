                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
                     link so they can decide whether they want to follow the link. Whenever possible, provide
                     link text that identifies the purpose of the link without needing additional context.
                     Assistive technology has the ability to provide users with a list of links that are
                     on the Web page. Link text that is as meaningful as possible will aid users who want
                     to choose from this list of links. Meaningful link text also helps those who wish
                     to tab from link to link. Meaningful links help users choose which links to follow
                     without requiring complicated strategies to understand the page.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The text of, or associated with, the link is intended to describe the purpose of the
                     link. In cases where the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name
                     of the document or web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of
                     the link (which is to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is
                     not required to use the name of the document or web application; other things may
                     also describe the purpose of the link. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     
                     <a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
                     being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
                     Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
                     continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>In some situations, authors may want to provide part of the description of the link
                     in logically related text that provides the context for the link. In this case the
                     user should be able to identify the purpose of the link without moving focus from
                     the link. In other words, they can arrive on a link and find out more about it without
                     losing their place. This can be achieved by putting the description of the link in
                     the same sentence, paragraph, list item, or table cell as the link, or in the table
                     header cell for a link in a data table, because these are directly associated with
                     the link itself. Alternatively, authors may choose to use an ARIA technique to associate
                     additional
                     text on the page with the link.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>This context will be most usable if it precedes the link. (For instance, if you must
                     use ambiguous link text, it is better to put it at the end of the sentence that describes
                     its destination, rather than putting the ambiguous phrase at the beginning of the
                     sentence.) If the description follows the link, there can be confusion and difficulty
                     for screen reader users who are reading through the page in order (top to bottom).
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a best practice for links with the same destination to have consistent text
                     (and this is a requirement per 
                     <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> for pages in a set). It is also a best practice for links with different purposes
                     and destinations to have different link text.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>A best practice for links to <a href="#dfn-conforming-alternate-version">conforming alternate versions</a> is to ensure that the link text to the conforming alternate version indicates in
                     link text that the page it leads to represents the more accessible version. This information
                     may also be provided in text - the goal is to ensure that the end user knows what
                     the purpose of the link is. 
                  </p>
                  <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
                     link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
                     the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
                     available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
                     on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
                     available in the link text or programmatically associated with the link to satisfy
                     the Success Criterion.

                           or obscured. For instance, a game may have links identified only as door #1, door
                           #2, and door #3. This link text would be sufficient because the purpose of the links
                           is to create suspense for all users.

                           for each format), the first link for each book is the title of the book, the second
                           link says "PDF" and the third says, "mp3."

                           A Web page contains a collection of news articles. The main page lists the first few
                           sentences of each article, followed by a "Read more" link. A screen reader command
                           to read the current paragraph provides the context to interpret the purpose of the
                           link.
