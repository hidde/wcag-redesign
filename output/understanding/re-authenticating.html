                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to allow all users to complete authenticated
                     transactions that have inactivity time limits or other circumstances that would cause
                     a user to be logged out while in the midst of completing the transaction.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>For security reasons, many sites implement an authentication time limit after a certain
                     period of inactivity. These time limits may cause problems for persons with disabilities
                     because it may take longer for them to complete the activity. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Other sites will log a person out of a session if a person logs in on the Web site
                     from another computer or if other activities arise that make the site suspicious of
                     whether the person is still the same legitimate person who logged in originally. When
                     users are logged out while still in the midst of a transaction - it is important that
                     they be given the ability to re-authenticate and continue with the transaction without
                     the loss of any data already entered.

                     <li>This Success Criterion benefits people who may require additional time to complete
                        an activity. People with cognitive limitations may read slowly and require additional
                        time to read and respond to a questionnaire. Users interacting via a screen reader
                        may need extra time to navigate and complete a complicated form. 
                        A person with motor impairments or who navigates with an alternative input device
                        may require additional time to navigate through or complete input within a form.

                        a user who is deaf, control over time limits is also important.

                           takes so long to enter credit card information into the application that a time limit
                           occurs while the user is performing the checkout process. When the user returns to
                           the checkout process and submits the form, the site returns a login screen to re-authenticate.
                           After the user logs in, the check out process is restored with the same information
                           and at the same stage. The user did not lose any data because the server had temporarily
                           accepted and stored the submission even though the session had timed out and restored
                           the user to the same state after re-authentication was completed.

                           the user several minutes before the time-out occurs and provides a link to open a
                           new window in order to re-authenticate. The original window with the in-progress email
                           remains intact and, after re-authentication, the user may send that data.

                           that the questionnaire can be saved at any point and completed at a later time. Within
