                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that user agents can correctly present
                     content written in multiple languages. This makes it possible for user agents and
                     assistive technologies to present content according to the  presentation and pronunciation
                     rules for that language. This applies to graphical browsers as well as screen readers,
                     braille displays, and other voice browsers.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Both assistive technologies and conventional user agents can render text more accurately
                     if the language of each passage of text is identified. Screen readers can use the
                     pronunciation rules of the language of the text. Visual browsers can display characters
                     and scripts in appropriate ways. This is especially important when switching between
                     languages that read from left to right and languages that read from right to left,
                     or when text is rendered in a language that uses a different alphabet. Users with
                     disabilities who know all the languages used in the Web page will be better able to
                     understand the content when each passage is rendered appropriately. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>When no other language has been specified for a phrase or passage of text, its human
                     language is the default human language of the Web page (see Success Criterion 3.1.1).
                     So the human language of all content in single language documents can be programmatically
                     determined. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Individual words or phrases in one language can become part of another language. For
                     example, "rendezvous" is a French word that has been adopted in English, appears in
                     English dictionaries, and is properly pronounced by English screen readers. Hence
                     a passage of English text may contain the word "rendezvous" without specifying that
                     its human language is French and still satisfy this Success Criterion. Frequently,
                     when the human language of text appears to be changing for a single word, that word
                     has become part of the language of the surrounding text. Because this is so common
                     in some languages, single words should be considered part of the language of the surrounding
                     text unless it is clear that a change in language was intended. If there is doubt
                     whether a change in language is intended, consider whether the word would be pronounced
                     the same (except for accent or intonation) in the language of the immediately surrounding
                     text.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Most professions require frequent use of technical terms which may originate from
                     a foreign language. Such terms are usually not translated to all languages. The universal
                     nature of technical terms also facilitate communication between professionals.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Some common examples of technical terms include: Homo sapiens, Alpha Centauri, hertz,
                     and habeas corpus.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Identifying changes in language is important for a number of reasons:
                     	
                     
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     
                     <li>It allows braille translation software to follow changes in language, e.g., substitute
                        control codes for accented characters, and insert control codes necessary to prevent
                        erroneous creation of Grade 2 braille contractions.
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>Speech synthesizers that support multiple languages will be able to speak the text
                        in the appropriate accent with proper pronunciation. If changes are not marked, the
                        synthesizer will try its best to speak the words in the  default language it works
                        in. Thus, the French word for car, "voiture" would be pronounced "voyture" by a speech
                        synthesizer that uses English as its  default language. 
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>Marking changes in language can benefit future developments in technology, for example
                        users who are unable to translate between languages themselves will be able to use
                        machines to translate unfamiliar languages.  
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>Marking changes in language can also assist user agents in providing definitions using
                        a dictionary. 
                        
                     </li>
