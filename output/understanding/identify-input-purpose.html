                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that the purpose of a form input
                     collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that
                     user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities.
                     The ability to programmatically declare the specific kind of data expected in a particular
                     field makes filling out forms easier, especially for people with cognitive disabilities.
                  </p>
                  <p>Appropriate visible labels and instruction can help users understand the purpose of
                     form input fields, but users may benefit from having fields that collect specific
                     types of information be rendered in an unambiguous, consistent, and possibly customized
                     way for different modalities - either through defaults in their user agent, or through
                     the aid of assistive technologies.
                  </p>
                  <p>For some input fields, the type attribute already offers a way to broadly specify
                     the intention of the input field, for example, input type="tel", input type="email",
                     or input type="password". However, these are only very broad categories, describing
                     the type of input, but not necessarily its purpose, especially as it relates to user-specific
                     input fields. As an example, type="email" indicates that the field is for an e-mail
                     address but does not clarify if the purpose is for entering the user's e-mail address
                     or some other person's e-mail.
                  </p>
                  <p>This success criterion defines the types of user interface component input purposes,
                     found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#input-purposes">Section 7 of the WCAG 2.1 Recommendation</a>, that must be programmatically identifiable. When these user input purposes are present,
                     and if the technology supports doing so, the field purpose must be programmatically
                     identifiable.
                  </p>
                  <p>The HTML autocomplete attribute only accepts a certain number of specific well-defined
                     fixed values. This allows a more fine-grained definition or identification of purpose
                     than the type attribute, for example, by allowing the author to specify a specific
                     type of name: Name (autocomplete="name”), Given Name (autocomplete="given-name”),
                     Family Name (autocomplete="family-name”), as well as Username (autocomplete="username”),
                     and Nickname (autocomplete="nickname”).
                  </p>
                  <p>By adopting and repurposing this predefined taxonomy of definitions, user agents and
                     assistive technologies can now present the purpose of the inputs to users in different
                     modalities. For example, assistive technologies may display familiar icons next to
                     input fields to help users who have difficulties reading. An icon of a birthday cake
                     may be shown in front of an input field with autocomplete="bday", or the icon of a
                     telephone in front of an input field with autocomplete="tel".
                  </p>
                  <p>In addition to repurposing this taxonomy, when the autocomplete attribute technique
                     is used to meet this Success Criterion, browsers and other user-agents can suggest
                     and 'autofill' the right content by autocompleting these fields based on past user
                     input stored in the browser. By defining more granular definitions of common input
                     purposes, for example “Birthday” (autocomplete=”bday”), browsers can store personalized
                     values for each of these fields (the user's birthday date). The user is relieved of
                     having to type the information and can instead confirm or, if needed, change the value
                     of the field, a significant benefit for users with memory issues, dyslexia, and other
                     disabilities. Because the autocomplete values are independent of language, users that
                     may not be familiar with the text used to visually identify user input fields (the
                     label) can still have that purpose consistently identified to them due to the fixed
                     taxonomy of terms.
                  </p>
                  <p>If an input field accepts two different types of input purpose (as in combined user
                     name/user email fields) and the technology used does not allow multiple purpose values
                     to be defined, it is valid to provide either one or the other value or leave out the
                     designation of input purpose altogether.
                  </p>
                  <p>When the user agent and assistive technology support for other metadata formats matures,
                     metadata schemes like the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/personalization-semantics/content/">Personalization Semantics Content Module</a> may be used in addition or instead of the HTML autocomplete attribute to identify
                     the purpose of input fields. They can also support automated adaptations that identify
                     and match author-provided input labels to defined vocabularies or symbols that are
                     used instead for labelling inputs.
