               <h2>Intent</h2>
               <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that active user interface components
                  (i.e., controls) and meaningful graphics are distinguishable by people with moderately
                  low vision. The requirements and rationale are similar to those for large text in
                  <a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>.
               </p>
               <p>Low contrast controls are more difficult to perceive, and may be completely missed
                  by people with a visual impairment. Similarly, if a graphic is needed to understand
                  the content or functionality of the webpage then it should be perceivable by people
                  with low vision or other impairments without the need for contrast-enhancing assistive
                  technology.
               </p>

                  <h3>Active User Interface Components</h3>
                  
                  				
                  <p>For active controls any visual information provided that is necessary for a user to
                     identify that a control is present and how to operate it must have a minimum 3:1 contrast
                     ratio with the adjacent colors. Also, any visual information necessary to indicate
                     state, such as whether a component is selected or focused must also ensure that the
                     information used to identify the control in that state has a minimum 3:1 contrast
                     ratio.
                  </p>
                  
                  				
                  <p>This Success Criterion does not require that changes in color that differentiate between
                     states of an individual component meet the 3:1 contrast ratio when they do not appear
                     next to each other. For example, there is not a new requirement that visited links
                     contrast with the default color, or that mouse hover indicators contrast with the
                     default state. However, the component must not lose contrast with the adjacent colors,
                     and non-text indicators such as the check in a checkbox, or an arrow graphic indicating
                     a menu is selected or open must have sufficient contrast to the adjacent colors.
                  </p>
                  
                  				
                  <h3>Boundaries</h3>
                  				
                  				
                  <p>This success criteria does not require that controls have a visual boundary indicating
                     the hit area, but if the visual indicator of the control is the only way to identify
                     the control, then that indicator must have sufficient contrast. If text (or an icon)
                     within a button or placeholder text inside a text input is visible and there is no
                     visual indication of the hit area then the Success Criterion is passed. If a button
                     with text also has a colored border, since the border does not provide the only indication
                     there is no contrast requirement beyond the text contrast (<a href="contrast-minimum">1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)</a>). Note that for people with cognitive disabilities it is recommended to delineate
                     the boundary of controls to aid in the recognition of controls and therefore the completion
                     of activities.

                  <p>For user interface components 'adjacent colors' means the colors adjacent to the component.
                     For example, if an input has a white internal background, dark border, and white external
                     background the 'adjacent color' to the component would be the white external background.

                  <p>If components use several colors, any color which does not interfere with identifying
                     the component can be ignored for the purpose of measuring contrast ratio. For example,
                     a 3D drop-shadow on an input, or a dark border line between contrasting backgrounds
                     is considered to be subsumed into the color closest in brightness (perceived luminance).
                  </p>
                  
                  				
                  <p>The following example shows an input that has a light background on the inside and
                     a dark background around it. The input also has a dark grey border which is considered
                     to be subsumed into the dark background. The border does not interfere with identifying
                     the component, so the contrast ratio is taken between the white background and dark
                     blue background.

                     or the thumb of a slider, that part might be within the component so the adjacent
                     color might be another part of the component.

                  <h3>Relationship with Use of Color and Focus Visible</h3>
                  
                  				
                  <p>The <a href="use-of-color">Use of Color</a> success criterion addresses changing <strong>only the color</strong> (hue) of an object or text without otherwise altering the object's form. The principle
                     is that contrast ratio (the difference in brightness) can be used to distinguish text
                     or graphics. For example, <a href="/techniques/general/G183">G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual
                        cues on focus for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them</a> is a technique to use a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text to distinguish
                     links and controls. In that case the Working Group regards a link color that meets
                     the 3:1 contrast ratio relative to the non-linked text color as satisfying the Success
                     Criteria <a href="use-of-color">1.4.1 Use of color</a> since it is relying on contrast ratio as well as color (hue) to convey that the text
                     is a link.

                  <p>Non-text information within controls that uses a change of hue alone to convey the
                     value or state of an input, such as a 1-5 star indicator with a black outline for
                     each star filled with either yellow (full) or white (empty) is likely to fail the
                     Use of color criteria rather than this one.

                     the states. This is the basis for <a class="general" href="/techniques/general/G195">G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator</a>, and more techniques are being added.

                  <p>In combination with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#focus-visible">2.4.7 Focus Visible</a>, the visual focus indicator for a component <em>must</em> have sufficient contrast against the adjacent background when the component is focused,
                     except where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not
                     modified by the author.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>Note that this Success Criterion does not directly compare the focused and unfocused
                     states of a control - if the focus state relies on a change of color (e.g., changing
                     <em>only</em> the background color of a button), this Success Criterion does not define any requirement
                     for the difference in contrast between the two states.

                        control in HTML) are not required to meet contrast requirements in WCAG 2.1. An inactive
                        user interface component is visible but not currently operable. An example would be
                        a submit button at the bottom of a form that is visible but cannot be activated until
                        all the required fields in the form are completed.

                        interaction. The decision to exempt inactive controls from the contrast requirements
                        was based on a number of considerations. Although it would be benefitial to some people
                        to discern inactive controls, a one-size-fits-all solution has been very difficult
                        to establish. A method of varying the presentation of disabled controls, such as adding
                        an icon for disabled controls, based on user preferences is anticipated as an advancement
                        in the future.

                  <p>The term "graphical object" applies to stand-alone icons such as a print icon (with
                     no text), and the important parts of a more complex diagram such as each line in a
                     graph. For simple graphics such as single-color icons the entire image is a graphical
                     object. Images made up of multiple lines, colors and shapes will be made of multiple
                     graphical objects, some of which are required for understanding.
                  </p>
                  
                  				
                  <p>Not every graphical object needs to contrast with its surroundings - only those that
                     are required for a user to understand what the graphic is conveying. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Pr.C3.A4gnanz">Gestalt principles</a> such as the "law of continuity" can be used to ignore minor overlaps with other graphical
                     objects or colors.

                     <p>Gradients can reduce the apparent contrast between areas, and make it more difficult
                        to test. The general principles is to identify the graphical object(s) required for
                        understanding, and take the central color of that area. If you remove the adjacent
                        color which does not have sufficient contrast, can you still identify and understand
                        the graphical object?

                  contrast. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency that
