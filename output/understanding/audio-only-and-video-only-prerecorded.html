                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to make information conveyed by prerecorded
                     audio-only and prerecorded video-only content available to all users. Alternatives
                     for time-based media that are text based make information accessible because text
                     can be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile)
                     to match the needs of the user. In the future, text could also be translated into
                     symbols, sign language or simpler forms of the language (future).
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>An example of pre-recorded video with no audio information or user interaction is
                     a silent movie. The purpose of the transcript is to provide an equivalent to what
                     is presented visually. For prerecorded video content, authors have the option to provide
                     an audio track. The purpose of the audio alternative is to be an equivalent to the
                     video. This makes it possible for users with and without vision impairment to review
                     content simultaneously. The approach can also make it easier for those with cognitive,
                     language and learning disabilities to understand the content because it would provide
                     parallel presentation.
