                  <p>Target environments are defined by the user agents and assistive technologies available
                     to its users. Documentation of accessibility support involves detailed understanding
                     of the ways to use functionality of a technology to meet success criteria, and also
                     of user agents and assistive technology. Because of this, vendors and developers of
                     Web technologies and user agents are encouraged to provide this information about
                     the accessibility support of their products. Similarly, developers and vendors of
                     assistive technology are encouraged to provide this information about the ways to
                     use Web technologies that are supported by their products. Authors should need to
                     document the accessibility supported ways to use a technology only when there is not
                     reliable documentation available from vendors or testing groups for those uses. 
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>For a controlled environment, such as a corporate workplace, the user agents and assistive
                     technologies available may be a specific set of versions of user agents on a specific
                     set of platforms. To determine whether uses of a Web technology are accessibility
                     supported in a target environment, an author checks that the user agents and assistive
                     technologies available are in the set of supported user agents and assistive technologies
                     listed for those uses in the Accessibility Support documentation. 
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>For a target environment like the Internet, authors may need to consider a much larger
                     set of user agents, including older versions, and on a wider variety of platforms.
                     
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>Environments that use different natural languages are different target environments.
                     For example, the accessibility-supported ways of using technologies for an English
                     language environment may differ from those for an Arabic language environment, since
                     there may be different user agents and assistive technologies that support these languages.
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>The documentation includes version-specific information about all the assistive technologies
                     and all the user agents and the ways that they interact with one another. If support
                     in these user agents is similar, it will be straightforward for an author to decide
                     if a documented way of using a technology is accessibility supported. If the uses
                     supported are different in different versions, authors can only rely on the uses that
                     are supported in the versions available to their users in determining accessibility
                     support. 
                  </p>
                  		
                  <p>If a way of using a technology is not relied upon for conformance, the absence of
                     accessibility support for that use does not prevent conformance of the Web page. So
                     if the unsupported use does not occur in the content, or if there is a conforming
                     version of that content available, the Web page still conforms. For instance, lack
                     of accessibility support for interactive controls in a Web technology would not prevent
                     uses of the Web technology for non-interactive content that are accessibility supported.
