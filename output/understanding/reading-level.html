                  Content should be written as clearly and simply as possible. The intent of this Success
                  Criterion is:
                  
               </p>
               <ul>
                  
                  
                  <li>to ensure that additional content is available to aid the understanding of difficult
                     or complex text;
                     
                  </li>
                  
                  
                  <li>to establish a testable measure indicating when such additional content is required.</li>
                  
                  
               </ul>
               <p>This Success Criterion helps people with reading disabilities while also allowing
                  authors to publish difficult or complex Web content. Text difficulty is described
                  in terms of the level of education required to read the text. Education levels are
                  defined according to the International Standard Classification of Education [[UNESCO]],
                  which was created to allow international comparison among systems of education.
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>Difficult or complex text may be appropriate for most members of the intended audience
                  (that is, most of the people for whom the content has been created). But there are
                  people with disabilities, including reading disabilities, even among highly educated
                  users with specialized knowledge of the subject matter. It may be possible to accommodate
                  these users by making the text more readable. If the text cannot be made more readable,
                  then supplemental content is needed. Supplemental content is required when text demands
                  reading ability more advanced than the lower secondary education level—that is, more
                  than nine years of school. Such text presents severe obstacles to people with reading
                  disabilities and is considered difficult even for people without disabilities who
                  have completed upper secondary education.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Reading disabilities such as dyslexia make it difficult to recognize written or printed
                  words and associate them with the correct sounds. This is called "decoding" the text.
                  Decoding must be automatic in order for people to read fluently. The act of decoding
                  text word by word consumes much of the mental energy that most people are able to
                  use for understanding what they read.
                  Text that uses short, common words and short sentences is easier to decode and usually
                  requires less advanced reading ability than text that uses long sentences and long
                  or unfamiliar words.
                  
               </p>
               <p>The education level required to read text content (also called "readability") is measured
                  by analyzing selected passages of text from the Web page. If the Web page includes
                  text written for different purposes or different styles are used, the selected passages
                  include samples of the types of content in the Web page and the different styles in
                  which the content is written. (In many cases, the Web page contains only one kind
                  of text content—e.g., technical documentation, a legal notice, marketing material,
                  etc.—and all the content uses the same style.) 
                  
               </p>
               <p>Educators can also measure the education level required to read text content. For
                  example, qualified teachers can evaluate text according to local education standards
                  to determine if it requires reading ability beyond what is expected for students in
                  the last year of lower secondary education.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Because people's names, the names of cities or other proper names cannot be changed
                  to shorter names with fewer syllables, and because doing so or just referring to everyone
                  by pronouns can make sentences harder to understand, the success criterion specifies
                  that proper names can be ignored or removed from the text before assessing whether
                  it meets the reading ability requirement. Titles refer to the name of documents, books,
                  movies, etc. Titles are removed or ignored for the analysis because changing the words
                  in titles might make the titles easier to read but would make it impossible to understand
                  the item to which the title refers. This would make it harder to read and understand
                  the content. (e.g., a book, academic paper, article, etc.). Therefore, titles are
                  also exempted specifically. 
                  
               </p>
               <p>When a Web page contains multiple languages, a readability result should be calculated
                  for each language that constitutes at least 5% of the content and that is used in
                  full sentences or paragraphs (not just individual words or phrases). The overall readability
                  of the page should be judged on the language that yields the worst readability results.
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>The readability of content may also be determined by applying a readability formula
                  to the selected passage. Many (though not all) readability formulas base their calculations
                  on passages of 100 words. Such formulas have been developed for many languages.  The
                  number of words in the passage is counted and the length of the words is determined
                  by counting either the number of syllables or the number of characters. Most readability
                  formulas also count the number and length of sentences. The average length of words
                  and sentences in the content is then used to calculate a readability score.  (Some
                  languages, such as Japanese, may include multiple scripts within the same passage.
                  Readability formulas for these languages may use the number and length of such "runs"
                  in their calculations.)  The result may be presented as a number (for example, on
                  a scale from 0-100) or as a grade level.   These results can then be interpreted using
                  the education levels described in the International Standard Classification of Education.
                  Readability formulas are available for at least some languages when running the spell
                  checkers in popular software if you specify in the options of this engine that you
                  want to have the statistics when it has finished checking your documents.

                     <p>According to the Open Society Mental Health Initiative, the concept of Easy to Read
                        cannot be universal, and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit the
                        abilities of all people with literacy and comprehension problems. Using the clearest
                        and simplest language appropriate is highly desirable, but the WCAG Working Group
                        could not find a way to test whether this had been achieved. The use of reading level
                        is a way to introduce testability into a Success Criterion that encourages clear writing.
                        Supplementary content can be a powerful technique for people with some classes of
                        cognitive disability.

                           language version of the page may be easier to understand than a written language version
                           since sign language may be their first language. 
                           Some sites may decide to do both or other combinations. No technique will help all
                           users who have difficulty. So different techniques are provided as sufficient techniques
                           here for authors trying to make their sites more accessible. Any numbered technique
                           or combination above can be used by a particular site and it is considered sufficient
                           by the Working Group.
