                     function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just
                     the endpoints.

                  <p class="note">This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example,

                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that, wherever possible, content
                     can be operated through a keyboard or keyboard interface (so an alternate keyboard
                     can be used). When content can be operated through a keyboard or alternate keyboard,
                     it is operable by people with no vision (who cannot use devices such as mice that
                     require eye-hand coordination) as well as by people who must use alternate keyboards
                     or input devices that act as keyboard emulators. Keyboard emulators include speech
                     input software, sip-and-puff software, on-screen keyboards, scanning software and
                     a variety of assistive technologies and alternate keyboards. Individuals with low
                     vision also may have trouble tracking a pointer and find the use of software much
                     easier (or only possible) if they can control it from the keyboard.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Examples of "specific timings for individual keystrokes" include situations where
                     a user would be required to repeat or execute multiple keystrokes within a short period
                     of time or where a key must be held down for an extended period before the keystroke
                     is registered. 
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The phrase "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the
                     path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints" is included to separate those
                     things that cannot reasonably be controlled from a keyboard.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Most actions carried out by a pointing device can also be done from the keyboard (for
                     example, clicking, selecting, moving, sizing). However, there is a small class of
                     input that is done with a pointing device that cannot be done from the keyboard in
                     any known fashion without requiring an inordinate number of keystrokes. Free hand
                     drawing, watercolor painting, and flying a helicopter through an obstacle course are
                     all examples of functions that require path dependent input. Drawing straight lines,
                     regular geometric shapes, re-sizing windows and dragging objects to a location (when
                     the path to that location is not relevant) do not require path dependent input.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The use of MouseKeys would not satisfy this Success Criterion because it is not a
                     keyboard equivalent to the application; it is a mouse equivalent (i.e., it looks like
                     a mouse to the application).
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>It is assumed that the design of user input features takes into account that operating
                     system keyboard accessibility features may be in use. For example, modifier key locking
                     may be turned on. Content continues to function in such an environment, not sending
                     events that would collide with the modifier key lock to produce unexpected results.
