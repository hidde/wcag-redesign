                     Consultation with privacy professionals and legal counsel is advised when considering
                     data preservation as an approach to satisfy this success criterion.

                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that when a timeout is used, users
                     know what duration of inactivity will cause the page to time out and result in lost
                     data. The use of timed events can present significant barriers for users with cognitive
                     disabilities, as these users may require more time to read content or to perform functions,
                     such as completing an online form.
                  </p>
                  <p>During the completion of an online process, such as to reserve a hotel room or purchase
                     a plane ticket, a user with a cognitive impairment may become overwhelmed with lengthy
                     instructions and data input required to complete the process. The user may not be
                     able to complete the process in one sitting and may need to take a break. Users should
                     be able to leave a process without losing their current place within the process,
                     and without losing information that has already been entered. If users cannot take
                     a break and check their work, many will often be unable to complete a task correctly.
                  </p>
                  <p>This Success Criterion works in tandem with Success Criterion 2.2.1 Timing Adjustable,
                     but is specifically focused on notification of timeouts related to user inactivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>The best way to conform to this success criteria is to keep the user data for at least
                     20 hours. This enables the user with disabilities and the aging community to start
                     and finish a task, taking breaks as needed. However, when it is not practical to save
                     the user data the author must warn the user about the duration of inactivity which
                     will result in a timeout. Timeouts should be displayed to the user once at the beginning
                     of the related task or process and not at each step.
                  </p>
                  <p>This success criterion only applies to timeouts that are within the content provider's
                     knowledge or control. For example, if the user closes a web browser or device and
                     loses content in an open page that has not yet been submitted, the success criteria
                     has not been violated.

                  <h2>Benefits</h2>
                  <p>This Success Criterion helps users by ensuring they are notified about timeouts related
                     to inactivity.
                  </p>
                  <p>When a user knows how much time they are allowed for a task, they will know whether
                     they can take a needed break and resume their work without needing to start again.
                     This enables many users to complete tasks online that they otherwise could not do.
                     If a situation exists where a timeout is necessary, the user is warned at the start
                     of the task about the length of inactivity that would generate a timeout. The userÂ can
                     then decide if they can manage this task or not in the given time, or if they need
                     to prepare materials in advance of starting a process. This will reduce the frustration
                     of losing work due to a timeout.
                  </p>
                  <p>This Success Criterion helps people with many different cognitive disabilities, including
                     people with:

                        is stored for more than 20 hours. This helps ensure that if they need to stop working
                        for a while that they are more likely to be able to continue the purchase when they
                        return.

                     <li>A web application allowing people to file tax returns provides a notice that the application
                        will time out for security purposes. The notice indicates that a lack of activity
                        for a continuous period of time that is greater than an hour will trigger initiate
                        the time out process.

                        entered into the contact form can be submitted at any time and would only be lost
                        if the user closes their browser window.
