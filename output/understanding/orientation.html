                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that content displays in the orientation
                     (portrait or landscape) preferred by the user. Some websites and applications automatically
                     set and restrict the screen to a particular display orientation and expect
                     			that users will respond by rotating their device to match, but this can create
                     problems. Some users have their devices mounted
                     			in a fixed orientation (e.g. on the arm of a power wheelchair). Therefore, websites
                     and applications need to support both orientations
                     			by not restricting the orientation. Changes in content or functionality due to
                     the size of display are not covered by this criterion which is focused on restrictions
                     of orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>Historically, devices tended to have a fixed-orientation display, and all content
                     was created to match that display orientation. Today, most handhelds and many other
                     devices (e.g., monitors) have a hardware-level ability to dynamically adjust default
                     display orientation based on sensor information. The goal of this Success Criterion
                     is that authors should never restrict content's orientation, thus ensuring that it
                     always match the device display orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is important to distinguish between an author's responsibility not to restrict
                     content to a specific orientation, and device-specific settings governing the locking
                     of display orientation.
                  </p>
                  <p>Many hand-held devices offer a mechanical switch or a system setting (or both) to
                     allow the user to lock the device display to a specific orientation. Where a user
                     decides to lock their entire device to an orientation, all applications are expected
                     to pick up that setting and to display content accordingly.
                  </p>
                  <p>This Success Criterion complements device "lock orientation" settings. A web page
                     that does not restrict its display orientation will always support the system-level
                     orientation setting, since the system setting is picked up by the user agent. Alternatively,
                     where a device-level orientation lock is not in place, the user agent should display
                     the page according to the orientation of the device (either its default, or the current
                     orientation determined by any device sensors).
                  </p>
                  <p>The exception for things considered essential is aimed at situations where the content
                     would only be understood in a particular orientation, or where the technology restricts
                     the possible orientations. If content is aimed at a specific environment which is
                     only available in one orientation (such as a television) then the content can restrict
                     the orientation. Technologies such as virtual reality use screens within goggles that
                     cannot change orientation relative to the user's eyes.

                     <li><strong>Example 1: Online video site</strong><br />
                        				A video is shown in either portrait or in landscape based on the user's chosen
                        orientation.
                     </li>

                     <li><strong>Example 3: eReader web app</strong><br />
                        				An eReader web app can display the contents of a book in both portrait and landscape
                        orientation.
                     </li>
                     				
                     <li><strong>Example 4: Check deposit in banking app</strong><br />
                        				An example where orientation is essential could be a banking app that requires
                        the device be in landscape mode to easily and accurately capture an image of a check
                        for deposit. These paper forms are typically about twice as wide as they are high.
                     </li>
                     				
                     <li><strong>Example 5: Piano app</strong><br />
                        				An example where orientation is essential could be a piano app that requires the
                        device to be in landscape mode to allow room for enough of the piano keys to be functionally
                        usable. Since a piano app is emulating a physical piano keyboard that needs to retain
                        relative physical characteristics between keys, either too few keys would be available,
                        or the keys would be much too narrow.
