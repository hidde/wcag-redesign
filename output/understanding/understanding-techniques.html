                  <p>WCAG 2.1 guidelines and success criteria are designed to be broadly applicable to
                     current and future web technologies, including dynamic applications, mobile, digital
                     television, etc. They are stable and do not change.

                  <p>Specific guidance for authors and evaluators on meeting the WCAG success criteria
                     is provided in techniques, which include code examples, resources, and tests. W3C's
                     <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/">Techniques for WCAG 2.1</a> document is updated periodically, about twice per year, to cover more current best
                     practices and changes in technologies and tools.
