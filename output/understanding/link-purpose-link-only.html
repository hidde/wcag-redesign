                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand the purpose of each
                     link in the content, so they can decide whether they want to follow it. Best practice
                     is that links with the same destination would have the same descriptions, but links
                     with different purposes and destinations would have different descriptions (see also
                     
                     <a href="consistent-identification" class="guideline">Success Criterion 3.2.4</a> which calls for consistency in identifying components that have the same functionality).
                     Because the purpose of a link can be identified from its link text, links can be understood
                     when they are out of context, such as when the user agent provides a list of all the
                     links on a page.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The text in the link is intended to describe the purpose of the link. In cases where
                     the link takes one to a document or a web application, the name of the document or
                     web application would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the link (which is
                     to take you to the document or web application). Note that it is not required to use
                     the name of the document or web application; other things may also describe the purpose
                     of the link. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     
                     <a href="page-titled" class="understanding">Success Criterion 2.4.2</a> deals with the titles of pages. Here also, the name of a document or web application
                     being presented on the page would be sufficient to describe the purpose of the page.
                     Having the link and the title agree, or be very similar, is good practice and provides
                     continuity between the link 'clicked on' and the web page that the user lands on.
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The Success Criterion includes an exception for links for which the purpose of the
                     link cannot be determined from the information on the Web page. In this situation,
                     the person with the disability is not at a disadvantage; there is no additional context
                     available to understand the link purpose. However, whatever amount of context is available
                     on the Web page that can be used to interpret the purpose of the link must be made
                     available in the link text to satisfy the Success Criterion.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The word "mechanism" is used to allow authors to either make all links fully understandable
                     out of context by default or to provide a way to make them this way. This is done
                     because for some pages, making the links all unambiguous by themselves makes the pages
                     easier for some users and harder for others. Providing the ability to make the links
                     unambiguous (by them selves) or not provides both users with disabilities with the
                     ability to use the page in the format that best meets their needs.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>For example: A page listing 100 book titles along with links to download the books
                     in HTML, PDF, DOC, TXT, MP3, or AAC might ordinarily be viewed as the title of the
                     book as a link with the words "in HTML" after it. then the sentence "Also available
                     in: " followed by a series of short links with text of "HTML", "PDF", "DOC", "TXT",
                     "MP3", and "AAC". At Level 3, some users could opt to view the page this way - because
                     they would find the page harder to understand or slower to use if the full title of
                     the book were included in each of the links. Others could opt to view the page with
                     the full title as part of each of the links so that each link was understandable in
                     itself. Both the former and the latter groups could include people with visual or
                     cognitive disabilities that used different techniques to browse or that had different
                     types or severities of disability.
