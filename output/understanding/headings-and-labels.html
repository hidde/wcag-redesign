                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users understand what information
                     is contained in Web pages and how that information is organized. When headings are
                     clear and descriptive, users can find the information they seek more easily, and they
                     can understand the relationships between different parts of the content more easily.
                     Descriptive labels help users identify specific components within the content.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Labels and headings do not need to be lengthy. A word, or even a single character,
                     may suffice if it provides an appropriate cue to finding and navigating content.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>This Success Criterion does not require headings or labels. This Success Criterion
                     requires that if headings or labels are provided, they be descriptive. This Success
                     Criterion also
                     does not require that content acting as a heading or label be correctly marked up
                     or
                     identified - this aspect is covered separately by
                     <a href="info-and-relationships">1.3.1: Info and Relationships</a>. It is possible for content
                     to pass this Success Criterion (providing descriptive content that acts as headings
                     or labels) while failing
                     Success Criterion 1.3.1 (if the headings or labels aren't correctly marked up/identified).
                     Conversely,
                     it is also possible for content to pass Success Criterion 1.3.1 (with headings or
                     labels correctly
                     marked up or identified), while failing this Success Criterion (if those headings
                     or labels are not
                     sufficiently clear or descriptive).
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, in the case of labels, this Success Criterion does not take into consideration
                     whether or not
                     alternative methods of providing an accessible name for form controls and inputs has
                     been
                     used - this aspect is covered separately by <a href="name-role-value">4.1.2: Name, Role and Value</a>. It is possible
                     for controls and inputs to have an appropriate accessible name (e.g. using <code>aria-label="..."</code>)
                     and therefore pass Success Criterion 4.1.2, but to still fail this Success Criterion
                     (if the label is not
                     sufficiently clear or descriptive).
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>This success criteria does not require the use of labels; however, it does require
                     that if labels are present, they must be sufficiently clear or descriptive. Please
                     see <a href="labels-or-instructions">3.3.2: Labels or Instructions</a> for more information on the use of labels.
