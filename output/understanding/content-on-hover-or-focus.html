                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>Additional content that appears and disappears in coordination with keyboard focus
                     or pointer hover often leads to accessibility issues. Reasons for such issues include:
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                     			
                     <li>the user may not have intended to trigger the interaction</li>
                     			
                     <li>the user may not know new content has appeared</li>
                     			
                     <li>the new content may intefere with a user's ability to do a task</li>
                     		
                  </ol>
                  <p>Examples of such interactions can include custom tooltips, sub-menus and other nonmodal
                     popups which display on hover and focus. The intent of this success criterion is to
                     ensure that authors who cause additional content to appear and disappear in this manner
                     must design the interaction in such a way that users can:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     					
                     <li>perceive the additional content AND</li>
                     					
                     <li>dismiss it without disrupting their page experience.</li>
                     				
                  </ul>
                  <p>There are usually more predictable and accessible means of adding content to the page,
                     which authors are recommended to employ. If an author <em>does</em> choose to make additional content appear and disappear in coordination with hover
                     and keyboard focus, this success criterion specifies three conditions that must be
                     met:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     					
                     <li>dismissable</li>
                     					
                     <li>hoverable</li>
                     					
                     <li>persistent</li>
                     				
                  </ul>
                  <p>Each of these is discussed in a separate section.</p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>This SC covers content that appears in addition to the triggering component itself.
                        Therefore, a non-visible component, like a Skip to Main link, that is made visible
                        on keyboard focus (with no <em>additional</em> content beyond the trigger becoming visible) is not covered by the SC.
                        			
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <section id="dismissable">
                     			
                     <h3>Dismissable</h3>
                     			
                     <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that the additional content does not interfere
                        with viewing or operating the page's original content. When magnified, the portion
                        of the page visible in the viewport can be significantly reduced. Mouse users frequently
                        move the pointer to pan the magnified viewport and display another portion of the
                        screen. However, almost the entire portion of the page visible in this restricted
                        viewport may trigger the additional content, making it difficult for a user to pan
                        without re-triggering the content. A keyboard means of dismissing the additional content
                        provides a workaround.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>Alternatively, low vision users who can only navigate via the keyboard do not want
                        the small area of their magnified viewport cluttered with hover text. They need a
                        keyboard method of dismissing something that is obscuring the current focal area.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Two methods may be used to satisfy this condition and prevent such interference:</p>
                     			
                     <ol>
                        			
                        <li>Position the additional content so that it does not obscure any other content including
                           the trigger, with the exception of white space and purely decorative content, such
                           as a background graphic which provides no information.
                        </li>
                        			
                        <li>Provide a mechanism to easily dismiss the additional content, such as by pressing
                           Escape.
                        </li>
                        			
                     </ol>
                     			
                     <p>For most triggers of relatively small size, it is desirable for both methods to be
                        implemented.  If the trigger is large, noticing the additional content may be of concern
                        if it appears away from the trigger.  In those cases, only the second method may be
                        appropriate.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>The success criteria allows for input error messages to persist as there are cases
                        that require attention, explicit confirmation or remedial action.
                     </p>
                     			
                  </section>
                  <section id="hoverable">
                     			
                     <h3>Hoverable</h3>
                     			
                     <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure that additional content which may appear
                        on hover of a target may also be hovered itself.  Content which appears on hover can
                        be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer
                        over the trigger. When the added content is large, magnified views may mean that the
                        user needs to scroll or pan to completely view it, which is impossible unless the
                        user is able to move their pointer off the trigger without the additional content
                        disappearing.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>Another common situation is when large pointers have been selected via platform settings
                        or assistive technology. Here, the pointer can obscure a significant area of the additional
                        content. A technique to view the content fully in both situations is to move the mouse
                        pointer directly from the trigger onto the new content.  This capability also offers
                        significant advantages for users who utilize screen reader feedback on mouse interactions.
                        This condition generally implies that the additional content overlaps or is positioned
                        adjacent to the target.

                     <p>The intent of this condition is to ensure users have adequate time to perceive the
                        additional content after it becomes visible.  Users with disabilities may require
                        more time for many reasons, such as to change magnification, move the pointer, or
                        simply to bring the new content into their visual field.  Once it appears, the content
                        should remain visible until:
                     </p>

                        <li>The user removes hover or focus from the trigger and the additional content, consistent
                           with the typical user experience;

                        <li>The user dismisses the additional content via the mechanism provided to satisfy the
                           Dismissable condition; or

                           content is completely controlled by the user agent. A prominent example is the common
                           behavior of browsers to display the <code>title</code>  attribute in HTML as a small tooltip.

                        <li>Modal dialogs are out of scope for this criterion because they must take keyboard

                     <li>Users with low vision who view content under magnification will be better able to
                        view content on hover or focus without reducing their desired magnification.

                     <li>Users who increase the size of mouse cursors via platform settings or assistive technology
                        will be able to employ a technique to view obscured content on hover.

                     <li>Users with low vision or cognitive disabilities will have adequate time to perceive
                        additional content appearing on hover or focus and to view the trigger content with
                        less distraction.

                     <li>users with low pointer accuracy will be able to more easily dismiss unintentionally-triggered

                        <figcaption>Figure 1A tooltip is displayed below a LVTF button on hover so as not to obscure the button
                           itself. It does however obscure content below the button (the next red button, called
                           ~comment-zoom-content). To meet the Dismissible requirement, a user can press the
                           Escape key to clear the tooltip without moving the mouse, as demonstrated in the second
                           image.

                           The screen shot shows the same LVTF button with focus, but the tooltip has been dismissed
                           and is no longer visible.

                           be obscured by a large pointer.  The tooltip itself is able to be hovered so the mouse
                           pointer can be moved down to its bottom edge in order to view the tooltip text.
