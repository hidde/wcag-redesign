                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help people who are blind, people who have
                     low vision, and people with reading disabilities to understand content in cases where
                     meaning depends on pronunciation. Often words or characters have different meanings,
                     each with its own pronunciation. The meaning of such words or characters can usually
                     be determined from the context of the sentence. However, for more complex or ambiguous
                     sentences, or for some languages, the meaning of the word cannot be easily determined
                     or determined at all without knowing the pronunciation. When the sentence is read
                     aloud and the screen reader reads the word using the wrong pronunciation, it can be
                     even more difficult to understand than when read visually. When words are ambiguous
                     or indeterminate unless the pronunciation is known, then providing some means of determining
                     the pronunciation is needed.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     	For example, in the English language heteronyms are words that are spelled the same
                     but have different pronunciations and meanings, such as the words desert (abandon)
                     and desert (arid region). If the proper pronunciation can be determined from the context
                     of the sentence, then nothing is required.  If it cannot then some mechanism for determining
                     the proper pronunciation would be required. Additionally, in some languages certain
                     characters can be pronounced in different ways. In Japanese, for example, there are
                     characters like Han characters(Kanji) that have multiple pronunciations. Screen readers
                     may speak the characters incorrectly without the information on pronunciation. When
                     read incorrectly, the content will not make sense to users.

                           is provided to users in parentheses right after the word. Giving the reading of the

                           and then kana is spoken in order to provide the correct reading.
