                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to avoid distracting users during their interaction
                     with a Web page.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>"Moving, blinking and scrolling" refers to content in which the visible content conveys
                     a sense of motion. Common examples include motion pictures, synchronized media presentations,
                     animations, real-time games, and scrolling stock tickers. "Auto-updating" refers to
                     content that updates or disappears based on a preset time interval. Common time-based
                     content includes audio, automatically updated weather information, news, stock price
                     updates, and auto-advancing presentations and messages. The requirements for moving,
                     blinking and scrolling content and for auto-updating content are the same except that:
                     
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     
                     <li>authors have the option of providing the user with a means to control the frequency
                        of updates when content is auto-updating and
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>there is no five second exception for auto-updating since it makes little sense to
                        auto-update for a few seconds and then stop
                        
                     </li>
                     
                     
                  </ul>
                  <p>Content that moves or auto-updates can be a barrier to anyone who has trouble reading
                     stationary text quickly as well as anyone who has trouble tracking moving objects.
                     It can also cause problems for screen readers.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Moving content can also be a severe distraction for some people. Certain groups, particularly
                     those with attention deficit disorders, find blinking content distracting, making
                     it difficult for them to concentrate on other parts of the Web page. Five seconds
                     was chosen because it is long enough to get a user's attention, but not so long that
                     a user cannot wait out the distraction if necessary to use the page.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Content that is paused can either resume in real-time or continue playing from the
                     point in the presentation where the user left off.

                           read content and works best when the content is not associated with a real-time event
                           or status.

                           that is real-time or "status" in nature. For example, weather radar, a stock ticker,
                           a traffic camera, or an auction timer, would present misleading information if a pause
                           caused it to display old information when the content was restarted.

                  <p>For a mechanism to be considered "a mechanism for the user to pause," it must provide
                     the user with a means to pause that does not tie up the user or the focus so that
                     the page cannot be used.  The word "pause" here is meant in the sense of a "pause
                     button" although other mechanisms than a button can be used.   Having an animation
                     stop only so long as a user has focus on it (where it restarts as soon as the user
                     moves the focus away) would not be considered a "mechanism for the user to pause"
                     because it makes the page unusable in the process and would not meet this SC.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>It is important to note that the terms "blinking" and "flashing" can sometimes refer
                     to the same content.

                     <li>"Blinking" refers to content that causes a distraction problem. Blinking can be allowed
                        for a short time as long as it stops (or can be stopped)

                     <li>"Flashing" refers to content that can trigger a seizure (if it is more than 3 per
                        second and large and bright enough). This cannot be allowed even for a second or it
                        could cause a seizure. And turning the flash off is also not an option since the seizure
                        could occur faster than most users could turn it off.

                        blinking occurs faster than 3 per second, it would also be considered a flash.

                        Although this is an effective technique for all users with vision, it can be a problem
                        for some users if it persists. For certain groups, including people with low literacy,
                        reading and intellectual disabilities, and people with attention deficit disorders,
                        content that blinks may make it difficult or even impossible to interact with the
                        rest of the Web page.

                           A stock ticker has "pause" and "restart" buttons. Pausing the ticker causes it to
                           pause on the currently displayed stock. Restarting causes the ticker to resume from
                           the stopped point but with a notice that the display is delayed. Since the intent
                           of the stock ticker is usually to provide realtime information, there might also be
                           a button that would advance the ticker to the most recently traded stock.
