                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to encourage authors, who are using technologies
                     which are capable of achieving their desired default visual presentation, to enable
                     people who require a particular visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the
                     text presentation as needed. This includes people who require the text in a particular
                     font size, foreground and background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>If an author can use text to achieve the same visual effect, he or she should present
                     the information as text rather than using an image. If for any reason, the author
                     cannot format the text to get the same effect, the effect won't be reliably presented
                     on the commonly available user agents, or using a technology to meet this criterion
                     would interfere with meeting other criteria such as 1.4.4, then an image of text can
                     be used. This includes instances where a particular presentation of text is essential
                     to the information being conveyed, such as type samples, logotypes, branding, etc.
                     Images of text may also be used in order to use a particular font that is either not
                     widely deployed or which the author doesn't have the right to redistribute, or to
                     ensure that the text would be anti-aliased on all user agents.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Images of text can also be used where it is possible for users to customize the image
                     of text to match their requirements.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
                     that is part of a picture that contains significant
                     other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
                     which visually
                     convey important information through more than just text.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Techniques for satisfying this Success Criterion are the same as those for Success
                     Criterion 1.4.9, except that they only need to apply if the visual presentation can
                     be achieved with the technologies that the author is using. For Success Criterion
                     1.4.9, the sufficient techniques would be applied only when the user can customize
                     the output.

                           text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
                           For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
                           the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
