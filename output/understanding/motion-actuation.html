                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that functions triggered by moving
                     a device (for example, shaking or tilting) or by gesturing towards the device (so
                     that sensors like a camera can pick up and interpret the gesturing), can also be operated
                     by more conventional user interface components.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>This criterion concerns input through sensors which respond directly to motions such
                        as gesturing towards, tilting or shaking a device. It does not cover the movement
                        of users through space as registered by geolocation sensors or beacons, or events
                        observed by the device other than intentional gesturing by the user. It also does
                        not cover incidental motion associated with operating a keyboard, pointer, or assistive
                        technology.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Devices often have sensors that can act as inputs, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
                     sensors on a phone or tablet device. These sensors can allow the user to control something
                     by simply changing the orientation or moving the device in particular ways. In other
                     situations, web content can interpret user gestures via the camera or other sensors
                     to actuate functions. For example, shaking the device might issue an "Undo" command,
                     or a gentle hand wave might be used to move forward or backward in a sequence of pages.
                     Some users with disabilities are not able to operate these device sensors (either
                     not at all, or not precisely enough) because the device is on a fixed mount (perhaps
                     a wheelchair) or due to motor impairments. Therefore, functionality offered through
                     motion must also be available by another mechanism.
                  </p>
                  <p>In addition, some users may accidentally activate sensors due to tremors or other
                     motor impairments. The user must have the ability to turn off motion actuation to
                     prevent such accidental triggering of functions. Applications may be able to meet
                     this requirement by supporting operating system settings which allow the user to disable
                     motion detection at the system level.
                  </p>
                  <p>There is an exception where motion is essential for the function or not using motions
                     or gestures would invalidate the activity. Some applications are specifically created
                     to use device sensor data. Examples of content that are exempt from this requirement
                     include a pedometer that relies on device motion to count steps.

                        (such as tilting, shaking, or gesturing) because the device may be mounted or users
                        may be physically unable to perform the necessary movement. This success criterion
                        ensures that users can still operate all functionality by other means such as touch
                        or via assistive technologies.
