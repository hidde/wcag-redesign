                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure consistent identification of functional
                     components that appear repeatedly within a set of Web pages. A strategy that people
                     who use screen readers use when operating a Web site is to rely heavily on their familiarity
                     with functions that may appear on different Web pages. If identical functions have
                     different labels (or, more generally, a different <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-aam-1.1/">accessible name</a>)
                     on different Web pages, the site will be considerably more difficult
                     to use. It may also be confusing and increase the cognitive load for people with cognitive
                     limitations. Therefore, consistent labeling will help. 
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>This consistency extends to the text alternatives. If icons or other non-text items
                     have the same functionality, then their text alternatives should be consistent as
                     well.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>If there are two components on a web page that both have the same functionality as
                     a component on another page in a set of web pages, then all 3 must be consistent.
                     Hence the two on the same page will be consistent.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>While it is desirable and best practice always to be consistent within a single web
                     page, 3.2.4 only addresses consistency within a set of web pages where something is
                     repeated on more than one page in the set.

                     <li>People who learn functionality on one page on a site can find the desired functions

                        same functionality, people with difficulty reading text or detecting text alternatives
                        can interact with the Web without depending on text alternatives.

                           form of the document title. Using different text alternatives to identify document
                           names for different documents is a consistent use of text alternatives.

                           the article. If the references to the next page read "page 2", "page 3", "page 4"
                           etcetera, the labels are not the same but they are consistent. Therefore, these references

                        <p>An e-commerce application uses a printer icon that allows the user to print receipts
                           and invoices. In one part of the application, the printer icon is labeled "Print receipt"
                           and is used to print receipts, while in another part it is labeled "Print invoice"
                           and is used to print invoices. The labeling is consistent ("Print x"), but the labels
                           are different to reflect the different functions of the icons. Therefore, this example
                           does not fail the Success Criterion.

                           The best practice would be to group them into one link as per 
                           <a class="html" href="/techniques/html/H2">H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource</a>. However if they are visually positioned one above the other but separated in the

                           these two links need only be consistent, not identical. But best practice is to have
                           identical text so that when users encounter the second one, it is clear that it goes

                           <p>Text alternatives that are "consistent" are not always "identical." For instance,
                              you may have a graphical arrow at the bottom of a Web page that links to the next
                              Web page. The text alternative may say "Go to page 4." Naturally, it would not be
                              appropriate to repeat this exact text alternative on the next Web page. It would be
                              more appropriate to say "Go to page 5". Although these text alternatives would not
                              be identical, they would be consistent, and therefore would satisfy this Success Criterion.

                           <p> A single non-text-content-item may be used to serve different functions. In such
                              cases, different text alternatives are necessary and should be used. Examples can
                              be commonly found with the use of icons such as check marks, cross marks, and traffic
                              signs. Their functions can be different depending on the context of the Web page.
                              A check mark icon may function as "approved", "completed", or "included", to name
                              a few, depending on the situation. Using "check mark" as text alternative across all
                              Web pages does not help users understand the function of the icon. Different text
                              alternatives can be used when the same non-text content serves multiple functions.
