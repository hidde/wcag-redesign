                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to ensure that all users can access information
                     that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
                     has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
                     in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
                     deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
                     another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Color is an important asset in design of Web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
                     its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
                     color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
                     users do not see color well. In addition, people using text-only, limited-color or
                     monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
                     only in color.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",
                     “error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples
                     of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open
                     in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example
                     of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
                     a required field had been left blank.

                           Form elements which are disabled via markup or scripting, are greyed out and made
                           inactive by the user agent. When in the disabled state these elements do not receive
                           focus. Assistive technologies can programmatically determine the state of disabled
                           elements and will provide this information to the user as the elements are encountered
                           on the page. The change in color and loss of focus provides redundant, visual information
                           about the state of the control.
