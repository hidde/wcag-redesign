                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to enable people who require a particular
                     visual presentation of text to be able to adjust the text presentation as required.
                     This includes people who require the text in a particular font size, foreground and
                     background color, font family, line spacing or alignment.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>This means implementing the text in a manner that allows its presentation to be changed
                     or providing a mechanism by which users can select an alternate presentation. Using
                     images of text is an example of an implementation that does not allow users to alter
                     the presentation of the text within it.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>In some situations, a particular visual presentation of the text is essential to the
                     information being conveyed. This means that information would be lost without that
                     particular visual presentation. In this case implementing the text in a manner that
                     allows its presentation to be changed is not required. This includes text that demonstrates
                     a particular visual aspect of the text, such as a particular font family, or text
                     that conveys an identity, such as text within a company logo.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Text that is decorative does not require implementing the text in a manner that allows
                     its presentation to be changed.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>The definition of image of text contains the note: Note: This does not include text
                     that is part of a picture that contains significant
                     other visual content. Examples of such pictures include graphs, screenshots, and diagrams
                     which visually
                     convey important information through more than just text.

                           is used to position the text; set the spacing between lines; as well as display the

                           is included as a jpeg image which does not allow the text characteristics to be changed.

                           including functions to style the text and check spelling. Some of the buttons use
                           text characters that do not form a sequence that expresses something in human language.
                           For example "B" to increase font weight, "I" to italicize the text and "ABC" to check
                           the spelling. The symbolic text characters are included as gif images which do not
                           allow the text characteristics to be changed. The buttons have text alternatives.
