                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help users with disabilities avoid serious
                     consequences as the result of a mistake when performing an action that cannot be reversed.
                     For example, purchasing non-refundable airline tickets or submitting an order to purchase
                     stock in a brokerage account are financial transactions with serious consequences.
                     If a user has made a mistake on the date of air travel, he or she could end up with
                     a ticket for the wrong day that cannot be exchanged. If the user made a mistake on
                     the number of stock shares to be purchased, he or she could end up purchasing more
                     stock than intended. Both of these types of mistakes involve transactions that take
                     place immediately and cannot be altered afterwards, and can be very costly. Likewise,
                     it may be an unrecoverable error if users unintentionally modify or delete data stored
                     in a database that they later need to access, such as their entire travel profile
                     in a travel services web site. When referring to modification or deletion of 'user
                     controllable' data, the intent is to prevent mass loss of data such as deleting a
                     file or record. It is not the intent to require a confirmation for each save command
                     or the simple creation or editing of documents, records or other data.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>Users with disabilities may be more likely to make mistakes. People with reading disabilities
                     may transpose numbers and letters, and those with motor disabilities may hit keys
                     by mistake. Providing the ability to reverse actions allows users to correct a mistake
                     that could result in serious consequences. Providing the ability to review and correct
                     information gives the user an opportunity to detect a mistake before taking an action
                     that has serious consequences.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>User-controllable data is user-viewable data that the user can change and/or delete
                     through an intentional action. Examples of the user controlling such data would be
                     updating the phone number and address for the user's account, or deleting a record
                     of past invoices from a website. It does not refer such things as internet logs and
                     search engine monitoring data that the user can't view or interact with directly.

                           is open. If it is after hours, the user is alerted that the transaction will be an
                           after-hours transaction, is told about the risks of trading outside of regular market
