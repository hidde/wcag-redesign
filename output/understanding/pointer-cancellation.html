                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this success criterion is to make it easier for users to prevent accidental
                     or erroneous pointer input. People with various disabilities can inadvertently initiate
                     touch or mouse events with unwanted results. Each of the following subsections roughly
                     aligns with the bullets of this Success Criterion, and outlines a means of allowing
                     users to cancel pointer operations.
                  </p>
                  <section id="up-event-activation-or-completion">
                     			
                     <h3>Up-Event activation or completion</h3>
                     			
                     <p>The most accessible way to incorporate pointer cancellation is to make activation
                        occur on the up-event.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Up-event activation refers to the activation of a target when the pointer is released.
                        In a touchscreen interaction, when the finger touches a target, the up-event activation
                        only occurs when the finger is lifted while still being within the target boundary.
                        Similarly in mouse interaction, the up-event occurs when the mouse button is released
                        while the cursor is still within the boundary of the initial target set when the mouse
                        button was pressed.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Authors can reduce the problem of users inadvertently triggering an action by using
                        generic platform activation/click events that activate functionality on the up-event.
                        For example, the <code>click</code> event in JavaScript triggers on release of the primary mouse button, and is an example
                        of an implicit up-event. Despite its name, the <code>click</code> event is device-independent and also works for touch and keyboard interaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The preference for up-events is implicit in the Success Criterion wording of the first
                        bullet: <q>The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function.</q> Authors meet the first bullet by using only the up-event.
                     </p> 
                     			
                  </section>
                  <section id="up-event-abort-or-undo">
                     
                     <h3>Up-Event Abort or Undo</h3>
                     
                     <p>Where the interaction is equivalent to a simple "click", up-event activation has a
                        built-in ability to cancel. There is a distinction between when someone touches a
                        screen and when they remove their finger. Similarly, in mouse interaction, there is
                        a difference between pressing and releasing the mouse button. When activation occurs
                        only as the pointer is released, users have the opportunity to Abort (cancel) the
                        activation. Users who have difficulty accurately using a mouse or touchscreen benefit
                        greatly from this basic behaviour. They normally receive visual feedback when an item
                        is pressed. If they discover they have selected the wrong item, they can cancel the
                        action by moving their pointer or finger away from the target before releasing.
                     </p>
                     			
                     
                     <p>For more complex interactions, such as drag and drop, the down- and up-events may
                        initiate and end a series of actions to complete a process. For example, with drag
                        and drop, the item may be:
                     </p>
                     
                     <ol>
                        
                        <li>selected with a press (down-event),</li>
                        
                        <li>moved to a new location, while still being depressed, and</li>
                        
                        <li>released (up-event) to conclude the drop action.</li>
                        
                     </ol>
                     
                     <p>In such a complex action, the need for an Abort or Undo function increases. Designers
                        may elect to confirm the move through something like a confirmation dialog or an undo
                        button, giving the user the ability to Undo the process just completed. Alternatively,
                        the ability to Abort the action can be acheived if, before completing step 3, the
                        user returns the selected item to its original location and concludes the process
                        there. If other parts of the screen disallow a move, the user can conclude the drag
                        and drop there, effectively nullifying the operation.

                     <h3>Up Reversal</h3>
                     
                     <p>In other interactions, the down-event may trigger a behaviour which can be reversed
                        when the up-event concludes. Examples of this include press-and-hold actions such
                        as where a transient popup appears (or a video plays) when the user presses on an
                        object (down-event), but the popup (or video) disappears as soon as the user releases
                        the pointer (up-event). Since the up-event reverses the preceding down event, the
                        user is returned to their prior point, and has effectively cancelled the operation.
                     </p>

                     <h3>Down-Event</h3>
                     
                     <p>Completing the function on the down-event is only permitted when it is essential that
                        the up-event not be used.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The most prevalent essential down-event activation occurs in keyboard emulation. On
                        a physical keyboard, keys by default activate on the down-event -- a letter appears
                        when the key is pressed. If a software keyboard emulator tried to override this expected
                        behaviour by making letters appear when the key is released, the behaviour would be
                        unexpected and would adversely affect expected interaction.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Note that a keyboard has a built-in Backspace or Delete button, which effectively
                        provides an Undo option. Undo is not a requirement of the down-event Essential exception;
                        however, providing an easy way for users to undo any action is a recommended practice
                        (and may be a functional necessity), even where it is not a requirement of this Success
                        Criterion.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>Other examples where the timing of an activation is essential and requires the down-event
                        would be:
                     </p>

                        <li>An activity that emulates a physical on-press trigger, such as when playing an on-screen
                           piano keyboard. Activation on the up-event would significantly alter the desired behaviour.
                        </li>
                        				
                        <li>A program for shooting skeets where waiting for the "up" event would invalidate the
