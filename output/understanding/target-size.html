               <section id="intent">
                  <h2>Intent</h2>
                  <p>The intent of this success criteria is to ensure that target sizes are large enough
                     for users to easily activate them, even if the user is accessing content on a small
                     handheld touch screen device, has limited dexterity, or has trouble activating small
                     targets for other reasons. For instance, mice and similar pointing devices can be
                     hard to use for these users, and a larger target will help them activate the target.
                  </p>
                  <p>Touch is particularly problematic as it is an input mechanism with coarse precision.
                     Users lack the same level of fine control when using inputs such as a mouse or stylus.
                     A finger is larger than a mouse pointer, and generally obstructs the user's
                     view of the precise location on the screen that is being touched/activated.
                  </p>
                  <p>The issue can even be further complicated with responsive layouts on small screens
                     like mobile, which need to accommodate different types of fine and coarse inputs.
                     Both input types must be supported for a site that can be accessed both on a traditional
                     desktop/laptop with a mouse, as well as on a tablet or mobile phone with a touch screen.
                  </p>
                  <p>While this criterion defines a minimum target size, as a best practice it is recommended
                     that larger sizes are used to reduce the possibility of unintentional activations.
                     This is particularly relevant if any of the following are true:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>A control is used frequently;</li>
                     
                     <li>Results of the interaction cannot be easily undone;</li>
                     
                     <li>The control is positioned where it will be difficult to reach, e.g. is near the edge
                        of the screen;
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>The control is part of a sequential task.</li>
                     
                  </ul>
                  <p>The targets on a screen can have different purposes and uses, and this Success Criterion
                     specifies how each is to be handled.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Equivalent targets:</strong> If there is more than one target on a screen that performs the same action, only
                     one of the targets need to meet the target size of 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Inline:</strong> Content displayed can often be reflowed based on the screen width available. This
                     is known as responsive design and makes it easier to read since you do not need to
                     scroll both horizontally and vertically. In reflowed content,
                     the targets can appear anywhere on a line and can change position based on the width
                     of the available screen. Since targets can appear anywhere on the line, the size cannot
                     be larger than the available text and spacing between the sentences or paragraphs,
                     otherwise the targets could overlap. It is for this reason targets which are contained
                     within one or more sentences are excluded from the target size requirements.
                  </p>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>If the target is the full sentence and the sentence is not in a block of text, then
                        the target needs to be at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="note">
                     <div role="heading" class="note-title marker" aria-level="3">Note</div>
                     <p>A footnote or an icon within or at the end of a sentence is considered to be part
                        of a sentence and therefore are excluded from the minimum target size.
                     </p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>User Agent Control:</strong> If the size of the target is not modified by the author through CSS or other size
                     properties, then the target does not need to meet the target size of 44 by 44 CSS
                     pixels.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Essential:</strong> If the target is required to be a particular target size and cannot be provided in
                     another way, while changing it would essentially change the information or functionality
                     of the content, then the target does not need to
                     meet the target size of 44 by 44 CSS pixels.

                     <li><strong>Example 1: Buttons</strong><br /> Three buttons are on-screen and the touch target area of each button is 44 by 44
                        CSS pixels.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 2: Equivalent target</strong><br /> Multiple targets are provided on the page that perform the same function. One of
                        the targets is 44 by 44 CSS pixels. The other targets do not have a minimum touch
                        target of 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 3: Anchor Link</strong><br /> The target is an in-page link and the target is less than 44 by 44 CSS pixels. Users
                        can scroll the screen using browser functions so target size does not need to be met.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 4: Text Link in a paragraph</strong><br /> Links within a paragraph of text have varying touch target dimensions. Links within
                        paragraphs of text do no need to meet the 44 by 44 CSS pixels requirements.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 5: Text Link in a sentence</strong><br /> A text link that is in a sentence is excluded and does not need to meet the 44 by
                        44 CSS pixel requirement. If the text link is the full sentence, then the text link
                        target touch area does
                        need to meet the 44 by 44 CSS pixels.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 6: Footnote</strong><br /> A footnote link at the end of a sentence does not need to meet the 44 by 44 CSS pixels
                        requirements. The footnote at the end of the sentence is considered to be part of
                        the sentence.
                     </li>
                     
                     <li><strong>Example 7: Help icon</strong><br /> A help icon within or at the end of a sentence does not need to meet the 44 by 44
                        CSS pixels requirements. The icon at the end of the sentence is considered to be part
                        of the sentence.
