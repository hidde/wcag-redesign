               <h2>Intent</h2>
               <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to provide enough contrast between text and
                  its background so that it can be read by people with moderately low vision (who do
                  not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). For people without color deficiencies,
                  hue and saturation have minimal or no effect on legibility as assessed by reading
                  performance (Knoblauch et al., 1991). Color deficiencies can affect luminance contrast
                  somewhat. Therefore, in the recommendation, the contrast is calculated in such a way
                  that color is not a key factor so that people who have a color vision deficit will
                  also have adequate contrast between the text and the background.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Text that is decorative and conveys no information is excluded. For example, if random
                  words are used to create a background and the words could be rearranged or substituted
                  without changing meaning, then it would be decorative and would not need to meet this
                  criterion. 
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>Text that is larger and has wider character strokes is easier to read at lower contrast.
                  The contrast requirement for larger text is therefore lower. This allows authors to
                  use a wider range of color choices for large text, which is helpful for design of
                  pages, particularly titles. 18 point text or 14 point bold text is judged to be large
                  enough to require a lower contrast ratio. (See The American Printing House for the
                  Blind Guidelines for Large Printing and The Library of Congress Guidelines for Large
                  Print under 
                  <a href="#resources">Resources</a>). "18 point" and "bold" can both have different meanings in different fonts but,
                  except for very thin or unusual fonts, they should be sufficient. Since there are
                  so many different fonts, the general measures are used and a note regarding fancy
                  or thin fonts is included.

                     <p>When evaluating this success criterion, the font size in points should be obtained
                        from the user agent or calculated on font metrics in the way that user agents do.
                        Point sizes are based on the CSS pt size as defined in 
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-values-3/#reference-pixel">CSS3 Values</a>. The ratio between sizes in points and CSS pixels is 1pt = 1.333px, therefore 14pt
                        and 18pt are equivalent to approximately 18.5px and 24px.
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Because different image editing applications default to different pixel densities
                        (e.g. 72 PPI or 96 PPI), specifying point sizes for fonts from within an image editing
                        application can be unreliable when it comes to presenting text at a specific size.
                        When creating images of large-scale text, authors should ensure that the text in the
                        resulting image is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the
                        default size for body text. For example, for a 72 PPI image, an author would need
                        to use approximately 19 pt and 24 pt font sizes in order to successfully present images
                        of large-scale text to a user. 
                        
                     </p>
                     
                     
                  </div>
               </div>
               <p>The previously-mentioned contrast requirements for text also apply to images of text
                  (text that has been rendered into pixels and then stored in an image format) as stated
                  in Success Criterion 1.4.3.
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>This requirement applies to situations in which images of text were intended to be
                  understood as text. Incidental text, such as in photographs that happen to include
                  a street sign, are not included. Nor is text that for some reason is designed to be
                  invisible to all viewers. Stylized text, such as in corporate logos, should be treated
                  in terms of its function on the page, which may or may not warrant including the content
                  in the text alternative. Corporate visual guidelines beyond logo and logotype are
                  not included in the exception.
                  
                  
               </p>
               <p>In this provision there is an exception that reads "that are part of a picture that
                  contains significant other visual content,". This exception is intended to separate
                  pictures that have text in them from images of text that are done to replace text
                  in order to get a particular look.

                     <p>Images of text do not scale as well as text because they tend to pixelate. It is also
                        harder to change foreground and background contrast and color combinations for images
                        of text, which is necessary for some users. Therefore, we suggest using text wherever
                        possible, and when not, consider supplying an image of higher resolution.

               </div>
               <p>The minimum contrast success criterion (1.4.3) applies to text in the page, including
                  placeholder text and text that is shown when a pointer is hovering over an object
                  or when an object has keyboard focus. If any of these are used in a page, the text
                  needs to provide sufficient contrast.
                  
               </p>
               <p>Although this Success Criterion only applies to text, similar issues occur for content
                  presented in charts, graphs, diagrams, and other non-text-based information.
                  Content presented in this manner should also have good contrast to ensure that more
                  users can access the information.

                  <p>Hues are perceived differently by users with color vision deficiencies (both congenital
                     and acquired) resulting in different colors and relative luminance contrasts than
                     for normally sighted users. Because of this, effective contrast and readability are
                     different for this population. However, color deficiencies are so diverse that prescribing
                     effective general use color pairs (for contrast) based on quantitative data is not
                     feasible. Requiring good luminance contrast accommodates this by requiring contrast
                     that is independent of color perception. Fortunately, most of the luminance contribution
                     is from the mid and long wave receptors which largely overlap in their spectral responses.
                     The result is that effective luminance contrast can generally be computed without
                     regard to specific color deficiency, except for the use of predominantly long wavelength
                     colors against darker colors (generally appearing black) for those who have protanopia.

                        <p>Some people with cognitive disabilities require color combinations or hues that have
                           low contrast, and therefore we allow and encourage authors to provide mechanisms to
                           adjust the foreground and background colors of the content. Some of the combinations
                           that could be chosen may have contrast levels that will be lower than those found
                           in the Success Criteria. This is not a violation of this Success Criteria provided
                           there is a mechanism that will return to the default values set out in the Success
                           Criteria.

                  <p>A contrast ratio of 3:1 is the minimum level recommended by [[ISO-9241-3]] and [[ANSI-HFES-100-1988]]
                     for standard text and vision. The 4.5:1 ratio is used in this provision to account
                     for the loss in contrast that results from moderately low visual acuity, congenital
                     or acquired color deficiencies, or the loss of contrast sensitivity that typically
                     accompanies aging.
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The rationale is based on a) adoption of the 3:1 contrast ratio for minimum acceptable
                     contrast for normal observers, in the ANSI standard, and b) the empirical finding
                     that in the population, visual acuity of 20/40 is associated with a contrast sensitivity
                     loss of roughly 1.5 [[ARDITI-FAYE]]. A user with 20/40 would thus require a contrast
                     ratio of 3 * 1.5 = 4.5 to 1.  Following
                     analogous empirical findings and the same logic, the user with 20/80 visual acuity
                     would require contrast of about 7:1.

                  <p>The contrast ratio of 4.5:1 was chosen for level AA because it compensated for the
                     loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                     to approximately 20/40 vision. (20/40 calculates to approximately 4.5:1.) 20/40 is
                     commonly reported as typical visual acuity of elders at roughly age 80. [[GITTINGS-FOZARD]]
                     
                     
                     
                  </p>
                  
                  
                  <p>The contrast ratio of 7:1 was chosen for level AAA because it compensated for the
                     loss in contrast sensitivity usually experienced by users with vision loss equivalent
                     to approximately 20/80 vision. People with more than this degree of vision loss usually
                     use assistive technologies to access their content (and the assistive technologies
                     usually have contrast enhancing, as well as magnification capability built into them).
                     The 7:1 level therefore generally provides compensation for the loss in contrast sensitivity
                     experienced by users with low vision who do not use assistive technology and provides
                     contrast enhancement for color deficiency as well.

                  <li>People with low vision often have difficulty reading text that does not contrast with
                     its background. This can be exacerbated if the person has a color vision deficiency

                     between the text and its background can make the text more readable even if the person
                     does not see the full range of colors. It also works for the rare individuals who
