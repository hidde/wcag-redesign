                  <h2>Description</h2>
                  <p>This technique is to seek confirmation from the user that the selected action is his
                     or her intended action. Use this technique in situations where the action can not
                     be undone after it has been followed through. This will help users avoid submitting
                     a form or deleting data by mistake.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, this may occur when the user expects the 'submit' and 'cancel' buttons
                     to occur in an order contrary to what is provided and selects a button too quickly
                     to notice the unexpected order. Presenting the user with a confirmation request allows
                     the user to recognize the error and either stop the submission of data or stop the
                     loss of entered data.
                  </p>
                  <p>The request for confirmation should inform the user of the action that was selected
                     and the consequences of continuing with the action.

                     <h3>Example 1: Airline travel</h3>
                     <p>An online travel Web site lets users create travel itineraries that reserve seats
                        with different airlines. Users may look up, amend and cancel their current itineraries.
                        If the user needs to cancel his travel plans, he finds the itinerary on the Web page
                        and deletes it from his list of current itineraries. This action results in the cancellation
                        of his seat reservations and is not reversible. The user is informed that the selected
                        action will cancel their current seat reservations and that it may not be possible
                        to make a comparable booking on the same flights once this action has been taken.
                        The user is asked to confirm or cancel the deletion of the itinerary.

                     <h3>Example 2: Webmail</h3>
                     <p>A Webmail application stores a user's email on a server, so that it can be accessed
                        from anywhere on the web. When a user deletes an email message, it is moved to a trash
                        folder from which it can be retrieved if it was deleted by accident. There is an "empty
                        trash" command for deleting the messages in the trash folder from the server. Once
                        the trash folder has been emptied, the messages can no longer be retrieved. Before
                        emptying the trash folder, the user is asked to confirm or cancel deletion of the
                        email in the trash folder.

                        is selected the user is presented with a web page that informs them of their choice
                        and asks for confirmation to continue. Example 1: "You have selected to reset the
                        form. This will delete all previously entered data and will not submit any answers.
                        Would you like to reset the form? [yes button] [no button]" Example 2: "You have selected
                        to submit the form. This will submit entered data as your final answers and can not
                        be changed. Would you like to submit the form? [yes button] [no button]"

                        user makes a transaction during trading hours, a dialog is presented informing the
                        user that the transaction is immediate and irreversible, and has buttons that say
                        "continue" and "cancel."
